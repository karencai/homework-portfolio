Assignment 1

Description
-----------
For the first assignment, you will begin creating the beginnings of your first website.
Take what you've learned from class and build a portfolio site that showcases all of the projects you'll be completing over the next few weeks. Build two pages - an 'About Page' and a 'Portfolio' - that link to one another.
Your 'About Page' should describe your mission and value proposition and your 'Portfolio' should include screenshots with descriptions of the work you [will] do for Relaxr, Startup Matchmaker, and CitiPix. Don't worry if you can't come up with any text for the pages-- we've provided you with some sample copy that you can use.
